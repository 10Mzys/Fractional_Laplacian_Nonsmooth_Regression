# Fractional_Laplacian_Nonsmooth_Regression
This is a pynb demo of the PCR-FLE algorithm (Principle Component Regression via Fractional Laplacian Eigenmaps). In the ipynb file, we considered PCR-FLE simulation with respect to the nonparametric regression on the picecwise constant/polynoimal functions (nonsmooth functions).
